A Part of Speech Tagging application written in Python.

Tagineer is available her as a general package, although a starter flask app py file and template are provided, similar to the ones used on the site.

The tagger works by first using wordbanks to look up words, tags them, and then deduces incorrect tags based on positioning of words in the text.
